# dijkstras-algorithm
Python program that uses Dijkstra's Algorithm on a sample graph, covering four cases/conditions. There are no other contributors nor current maintaining of the program. Instructions and sample graph are below: 

Also note that you need to cover at least the following 4 cases (sample example: slide 17) 
- Node(C) with Weight:2 is added to the 'Visited' {'A', 'B', 'C'}
- Relaxed: vertex[B]: OLD: Infinity, NEW: 4, Paths: {'B': 'A’}
- No edge relaxation is needed for node, C
- No unvisited outgoing edges from the node, D Then finally display the final results
